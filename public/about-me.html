                            <h2>About Jared.</h2>
                            <p>&emsp; Hello, I am Jared Webb, a student at Michigan Technological University. I am graduating in August of 2023 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. At that time, I will have graduated in three years due to transfer credits I received in high school.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>&emsp; I have competed in many programming and engineering competitions in high school as well as
                                college. The first was in middle school where I coded for the first time and fell in love with it. I oversaw
                                the teleoperating program for our robot in the first robotics competition. Next, I continued the
                                competition through our high school to which I was able to achieve a team captain role and I was put in
                                charge of the autonomous programs for that competition. After that, in college, I competed in
                                Spartahack 8, a hackathon put on by the student coding club at Michigan State where I created a website
                                in 24 hours that took in political articles and used a natural language processor trained on articles that
                                were graded by PolitiFact to pick up on tells of lying. Artificial Intelligence is not to the point yet where it
                                can determine the truth values of certain statements, but it is skilled enough to pick up on tells. The
                                articles were sorted into five categories based on truth value and the model was able to put the articles
                                in the correct place 44% of the time. The articles that were found to not have lying tells would be linked
                                on the front page and article that contained language commonly found in misleading articles and news
                                stories were put on a back page called the graveyard. Our team won the Domain.com best branding
                                award.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>&emsp;I am particularly interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I have taken all
                                the classes provided by my university in those fields. I have also been a part of enterprises and
                                extracurricular competitions on those subjects. I was a part of the IT Oxygen Enterprise where I worked
                                on a project in cooperation with Miller Welding to determine the quality of welds created by certain
                                machines. The welding machines could record the current, voltage, wire feed speeds, as well as time
                                spent on a certain weld. Our team created clustering models that could identify which group of welds
                                were for different parts. Then, our model was capable of detecting abnormalities in the data. For
                                example, whether the part had all the welds needed. In those cases, a supervisor would be alerted to
                                assure the quality of that part.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p> &emsp;Professional ethics and values are very important to me. I will seek out companies that match
                                my own. Companies that value integrity, honesty, and stability are ones that I will seek out. Corporations
                                can show honesty through transparency as well. Companies that provide open-source software are of
                                high moral character. I hope this information informs you about me better.
                            </p>
